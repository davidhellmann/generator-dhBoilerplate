/*
TECHNICALLY this selector is okay -- scanning-wise it's three tokens: IDENT (body), CHARACTER (*), IDENT (h2).
Parsing this as three elements names, where the first two don't have any of the optional trailing space.
However, most browsers (non-IE) don't recognize this as valid CSS and ignores the rule.
SO... we parse it properly. We just need to make sure that we don't add spaces where there aren't in the source.
