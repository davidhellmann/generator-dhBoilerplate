Lotus keen to make an impression in Australia

Lotus catching up with their rivals and targetting the top three is an
original article from F1 Fanatic.

If this article has been published anywhere other than F1 Fanatic it is an
infringement of copyright.After breaking into the top four in the
constructors’ championship last year Lotus has set its sights on reaching the
top three in 2013.
But that will involve beating some rivals with better equipment and more
resources than they have.
The team are reaping the benefits from upgrading their wind tunnel to a 60%
model and improving their Computational Fluid Dynamics capabilities in the
last two seasons.
The addition of a driver-in-the-loop simulator last year is a further step in
the right direction, although one that lead driver Kimi Raikkonen may not be
making the most use of.
The effective E20, aerodynamically sound and kind to its tyres, should have
won more races last year than the single victory that came the team’s way in
2012.
But with the benefit of stability in the driver line-up, and Raikkonen having
fully acclimatised to life in F1 again, Lotus should be ready to compete from
the off. The fine-tuning of the new car to his driving preferences,
    particularly in the steering department, will also help.
    In testing the E21 has looked swift but flaky, particularly in Raikkonen’s
    hands. The team believe the cold weather had a lot to do with its early
    gremlins, which included at least two gearbox failures, and they won’t be
    repeated once the season begins.
    The team expects to make some gains with its Coanda exhaust, which was
    still in an early and unoptimised form when they won the Abu Dhabi Grand
    Prix with it last year.
    But technical director James Allison said that alone won’t transform the
    E21: “I think that there’s a reason why every car on the grid has a
    similar-ish system on the car, that’s because there’s a lump of lap time
    to be had from it. It remains a very small proportion of what we used to
    be able to do in 2011 and it will therefore remain, relative to that, a
    much less important thing.”
    “Whether or not it’s going to be a big story in the year, I doubt it. The
    rules have been steady for a year and a bit now and most of what’s to be
    had is already being had. So I don’t think it will be a big thing.”
    “It’s a better system to use a well-developed Coanda system but it’s not
    like 2011 where if you didn’t have a blown floor you would have been off
    the pace by more than a second per lap and up to about two and a half.
    Whereas as you know our car wasn’t bad at all without such a system [last]
    year.”
    Allison added he isn’t concerned about the FIA’s ruling on Renault’s
    engine maps over the winter, which led to theories its customer teams
    could be disadvantaged.
    A key weakness for the team last year was its qualifying pace, though team
    principal Eric Boullier saw some improvements in that area late in the
    season: “I think Kimi’s second part of the season was delivering much in
    qualifying than at the beginning.”
    “So I think he’s going to be ready from race one and I think both drivers
    will be ready from race one in better [fitness] and better race condition
    than last year so we should be able as a team to deliver better from race
    one.”
    However he admitted the car’s one-lap pace is an area where they still
    “need some good progress”.
    Boullier added he will reserve judgement on the car’s capabilities until
    he’s seen it in action on a race weekend, but believes they are in a more
    competitive position this year: “My personal belief is we are getting
    closer to what we want to achieve, yes.”
    “We need to see now in real conditions, in the proper temperature and
    weather conditions for the tyres, how the car performance will be. And it
    looks like it’s going to be very tight. All the teams getting definitely
    closer to each other.”
