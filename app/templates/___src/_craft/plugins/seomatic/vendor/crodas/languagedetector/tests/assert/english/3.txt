Do you want to help seed? We are always looking for new seeders who can sustain 10mbit and/or higher upload speeds!

If you think you would be able to help seed at least five new torrents a day, likes the thought of receiving the shows
before everyone else while giving back to the community, and have some free time - please stop by our IRC channel and contact an op.
