"Doctor Who" depicts the adventures of a mysterious and eccentric Time Lord known as the Doctor (Matt Smith -11th doctor) who travels through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS, which normally appears from the exterior to be a blue 1960s British police box. With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of foes and saves civilizations, helping people and righting wrongs. 

Note: Doctor Who Confidential -- In September 2011, BBC controller Zai Bennett cancelled the series as a cost-cutting measure. People involved with the show such as Neil Gaiman who wrote "The Doctor's Wife" and Tom MacRae who wrote "The Girl Who Waited" have also expressed their concern with the axing of the programme. In 2012, seventh series executive producer Caroline Skinner announced that small behind-the-scenes features would be released on the BBC's Doctor Who website to make up for Confidential's cancellation.
